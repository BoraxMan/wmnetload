Title:		wmnetload network interface monitor
Version:	VERSION
Entered-date:	DATE
Description:	Network interface monitor dockapp for Window Maker.
		Designed to fit in well with dockapps like wmcpuload
		and wmmemmon.  Displays current network interface
		throughput and an auto-scaling graph of recent network
		activity.  The graph separates upstream and downstream
		traffic load without resorting to colors (for
		cleanliness).  wmnetload also indicates if the
		interface disappears or goes down.
